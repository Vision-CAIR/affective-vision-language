                        The questioner asks questions about a piece of art that is visible only to the Answerer. 
                        The Questioner's task is to decide on an emotion/feeling based on the responses.

                        In this task, to help you understand the task, imagine that you are a blind person who wants to engage in an emotional experience 
                        about an artwork and form an opinion about it by querying another person. 
                        As a "Questioner ", you do not have access to the art image, but you will have access to two subjective descriptions 
                        reflecting different emotions about the image. You will engage in a dialog with a person (a fellow Turker) 
                        who has access to the artwork image . Your role is to ask questions that are <strong>specific</strong> to the content of the image 
                        to decide on an emotion that the hidden artwork may trigger for you. At the end of the conversation, 
                        you will be given 9 possible emotions (awe, contentment, excitement, amusement, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, or 
                        something else) to choose from based on your conversation with your fellow Turker. At the end, you will also be 
                        requested to provide a text description that explains based on the conversation why you chose the selected emotion.  
                        Please refer to pieces of information from the conversation that informed your decision.
                        <strong>Very generic questions</strong> (e.g., <strong style="color: red">What is the image about?, “you are welcome”, “no more questions?”</strong>) are not allowed.

                        In this task, to help you understand the task, imagine that you are helping a blind person explore and appreciate an artwork that
                        you only can see by providing answers about the content of the artwork. 
                        As an "Answerer" you will have access to the artwork image as well as two subjective 
                        descriptions reflecting different emotions about the image. You will engage in a dialog with a person 
                        (a fellow Turker) who can not see the artwork image. Imagine if you are helping a blind person to experience 
                        the artwork that you can see but he/she does not. Your role is to help answer questions about the visual content 
                        that is specific to the art piece (not general questions). Also, please help the presumably blind fellow turker 
                        to form his/her own opinion about the art piece without imposing certain emotions, e.g. just saying this image is 
                        sad or joyful in your answers. Please also provide detailed answers (e.g., do not use short answers such as yes/no/maybe). 
                        What is important here is to help him/her create an emotional experience about the artwork. Please focus on describing 
                        the content from an artistic point of view including textures, the colors, peoples, animals, etc.

        Please complete one HIT before proceeding to the other. 
        Please don't open multiple tabs, you cannot chat with yourself. 
        We may measure the level of engagement in the task and the task may terminate 
        if a low level of engagement is detected or if instructions are violated. 
        Your data will be recorded ONLY when the dialog is complete (i.e., reaching a decision after 10 Questions and 10 answers) and no violation of instructions is detected. 
        Thus, we expect the questioner and answerer to work as a team to fully complete the HIT and receive the payment.
        Your participation is voluntary and you can stop at any time, but you will be paid for completed tasks only.
